# SCXcodeSwitchExpander

SCXcodeSwitchExpander is a small Xcode plugin that expands switch statements by inserting missing cases.

### Features

- inserts all possible switch cases

- keeps already used cases and only inserts missing ones (even if the type changes)

- only keeps the 'default:' case when used with the built-in Xcode snippet

- works on ivars, properties, method parameters etc.

- works with nested switches

- hooks into the undo manager stack (makes it easier to fix typos)

- fast and reliable (won't affect Xcode's performance in any signinficant way)

### Known Issues

- takes a bit for it to kick in after starting Xcode as it's waiting for the IDEIndexDidChange notification. I found that building the project usually makes that happen.

- does not work with anonymous enums
